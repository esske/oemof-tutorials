If you do not set a label, a random label is assigned, but this makes it difficult to track the results later on. The label and the python variable name do not have to match.

    "oemof.solph also allows you to pass additional parameters to the solver. For example, you can set a time limit after which the optimization will stop, even if no optimal solution has been found yet. These settings are provided through the `solver_options` argument, which expects a dictionary where the keys are solver‑specific option names and the values are the corresponding parameter values. Because each solver uses slightly different option names, we recommend consulting the documentation for the solver you are using.\n",

# Introduction

In this tutorial we are going through all the necessary background you need to start modeling your own energy system model. We assume that you have basic knowledge of mathematical optimization, including linear and mixed-integer linear programing. 

```{tip}
If you are completly new to mathematical optimization, we recommend starting here:
xyz
```

We will introduce you to the basic terminology of energy system modeling (with a focus on optimization). This is independent of the modeling tool or framework you want to use. For an introduction how to use omeof-solph to model energy system you can jump to [Link to ipynb with oemof-solph introduction].

Just as a quick recap, we will start with the difference between the different types of energy system models.

- Simulation models
    - here is some text
- Optimization models
    - here is some more text
- control models
    - here is again some text

During this tutorial we will mostly focus on optimization models, but some of the terminology is also applicable to the other types of models.

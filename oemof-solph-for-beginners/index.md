# oemof-solph Tutorial for total beginners

## Introduction

This tutorial is designed to guide you from being a complete beginner to building and running your own energy system model using [oemof.solph](https://oemof-solph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

We introduce the essential concepts of **energy system modeling** and, more specifically, **energy system optimization**. Step by step, you will learn how to translate these ideas into a working model using the `oemof.solph` framework.

While some of the content also appears in the official documentation, this tutorial provides a **coherent, hands‑on introduction** that brings together all the basics you need to get started.  
If anything remains unclear, feel free to refer to the oemof-solph documentation for additional explanations or alternative perspectives.

The workshop has been developed by [Eva Schischke](https://github.com/esske) at Fraunhofer UMSICHT.

## Structure of the Tutorial 

We will begin with the basic concepts of energy system optimization and the
mathematical background needed to understand and interpret model results.
You can find this introduction here:

➡️ [Introduction to energy system modeling](intro)

After that, the following section provides a detailed tutorial on how to build
your first model with `oemof.solph`, applying all concepts introduced earlier:

➡️ [Basic energy system models with oemof-solph](basics-model)

If you are looking for more advanced features — such as investment planning or
general non-convex (MILP) modeling—you can continue here:

➡️ [Some more advanced features](advanced-model)

(If you are not yet familiar with what *non-convex* means or why it matters for
investment planning, this tutorial will guide you through these concepts as well.)



## Good to Know Beforehand

This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with programming in Python, including
setting up environments, installing packages, and working with fundamental data
structures such as lists, dictionaries, classes, and functions. It is also
helpful if you already have some experience with packages such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
and/or [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

If not, we recommend the following (in our opinion) very good introductory
tutorials:

- Link 1  
- Link 2  
- Link 3  
- …

In addition, the tutorial assumes a basic understanding of mathematical
optimization — for example, knowing what a linear program is and what variables
and parameters represent in general.

To catch up on these concepts, we recommend:

- Kallrath  
- MIT videos  
- …
